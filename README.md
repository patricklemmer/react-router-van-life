# React Router v6 - VanlifeðŸšŒ

# Project Description

This is a basic React application built to demonstrate the use of [React Router v6](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)

Throughout the development process of this app, MirageJS was used to mimick a database holding all the relevant information such as images, profiles and user details. After finishing up the router setup I connected this app to Google Firestore.

## Concepts I learned

- Router Setup 
- Route 
- Link
- Route Parameters
- Nested Routes and Outlet
- Relative Paths
- NavLink 
- Link State
- 404 Page / Splat Routes
- Loaders
- Actions
- Form & form data
- defer()
- Await
- Suspense
- Error Handling, errorElement
- useRouteError, useNavigate, useNavigation, useLocation, useLoaderData, useActionData
- Protected Routes

## Documentation

### Search Filter

A user can filter by camper van type. Selecting a type (simple, rugged or luxury) will return a list of camper vans of that type.

Choosing a type will add a search parameter with the respective type selection to the URL (https://statuesque-kashata-fa42d8.netlify.app/vans?type=rugged)

The results of that search can be viewed and selected. Clicking on any listing will take the user to the details of that listing. (https://statuesque-kashata-fa42d8.netlify.app/vans/2/Beach%20Bum).

Clicking the "Back to rugged vans" sends the user back to the overview of all rugged vans, including the previously selected search parameters in the URL (https://statuesque-kashata-fa42d8.netlify.app/vans?type=rugged)

### Login

I have created an user account, to test the protected routes and log in to the hosts dashboard. To log in, use the following login details:

- Username: user@vanlife.com
- Password: van123

I also added a very basic logout scenario, that logs out a user and revokes access to all protected routes.

## Usage

This project contains protected routes for the sensitive data of a host. To test the full functionality of this app, you can use the following login details:

- Username: user@vanlife.com
- Password: van123
